    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to answer a very concerning question that most countries around the world are questionig themselves: \"how will the world be like after the Covid-19 crisis is behind us?\". In other words, how will the economy be shaped after the social distancing, the obligatory use of masks and constant fear of going outside is over? Many specialists believe that humanity will eventually move on and resume their pre-Covid routines, such as going in restaurants and enjoying events in closed spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "** But what new habits acquired during the pandemic will persist? **   \n",
    "\n",
    "That is exactly the question that many entrepreuners are asking themselves right now. They want to find in first-hand opportunities to invest in in business that caters to new acquired habits that will carry on after the pandemic is over. One of such habits that most people agree that will persist is the delivery of groceries and general goods, specially in big cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key aspects may explain why that might be the case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* During 2020, many business had to quickly adapt their supply and delivery chains in order to cater to new demands of a world hit by storm by a new decease that forced people to stay inside their homes for many months. That stablished a new sales and after-sales channels that had to mature in a record time. By 2021, that investment will probably not be lost and will continue to be used by many businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Costumers in general got used to order many things online during 2020, with online shopping tooking an exponential growth in a matters of weeks. This type of convenience is very appealing and even people that aren't normally very keen to shop online (middle-aged people) are already familiarized with this system. In 2021 this type of convenience might as well persist as a major delivery sales channel for many businesses and will no longer be a diffential, but a mandatory revenue stream for any new business to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that scenario, this final project explores the best locations for a delivery-focused market throughout New York City. As with any business, opening a new market requires throughout market study considering many key aspects in particular. The location of the market is one of the most important factors that will affect the outcome of the business. Hence, this project will attempt to find optimals locations to install a new delivery-focused market in New York, considering its neighborhoods profile and local venues locations.\n",
